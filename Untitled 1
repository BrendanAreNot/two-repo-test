This edit was made by me

And this edit was made by a member of the data team.


What if I make a different change?

And then another, normal change?

As long as the team and I work on different docs/sections...
... then we can avoid merge conflicts!

The team makes changes to the Untitled doc

And another change

And one more change from the team

Change from the team to Untitled 1

Team change

Work done by the team
